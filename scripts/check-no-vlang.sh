# check-no-vlang.sh — enforce "V-lang is banned in the estate".
#
# Estate rule: V-lang (vlang.io) is banned estate-wide (2026-04-10). It was
# migrated to Zig — the estate's default FFI/API/gateway language — via the
# `zig-unified-api-adapter`. Zig is ALLOWED and is deliberately NOT matched by
# this check; only V-lang references are treated as drift and must be removed.
#
# Searches for V-lang-specific content patterns in tracked files. The .v file
# extension is intentionally NOT used as a marker because Coq theorem files
# share that extension; this check looks at content patterns instead.
#
# Excludes:
#   .git/ (vcs internals)
#   affinescript/ (a separately-licensed AffineScript subtree; pattern hits
#       there are not estate-managed and false-positive on `.v` mentions in
#       linguistic / academic prose).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no V-lang references found
#   1 — V-lang references found (treat as drift)
#   2 — usage / setup error
